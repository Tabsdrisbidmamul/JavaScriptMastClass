        /*
        resolve()
            We pass into the callback function into the then() method as a parameter, and the callback function will always at least one parameter and that is the data that has been retrieved from the Promise

            In the DevTools we can see that Promised object has key-pair value called <value>: data retrieved 

            This is the data that retrieved when use a parameter in the callback function

            so when we do 
                (IDs => console.log(IDs);)

            we are doing
                console.log(<value>;)
                <value> := data retrieved back in this case 
                           [523, 883, 432, 974]
            
        reject()                   
            A common thing we do is to chain the then() and catch() method together like so 

            Promise.then().catch()

            depending on the method call - the <status> of the Promise object will change

            In the DevTools we have <value> for the data retrieved, but we also have <status> which defines the state of the Promise object rejected or resolved
                
            So from there the then() or catch() methods will be ran

            and like resolve() we can pass data into the reject() method as well

            chaining
            To avoid the "callback hell" -> which is a triangle or waterfall of callbacks within another callback

            We use promises to separate them out, which we then can return from one promise a successful result to another promise by chaining them together
            
        */
        // getIDs
        // .then(IDs => {
        //     console.log(IDs);
        //     // Here we return the ID retrieved from our "hypothetical" AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript And XML) call to the DB
        //     return getRecipe(IDs[2]);
        // })
        /* 
        
        - This return value here in return getRecipe(IDs[2]) is another Promise Object in which we pass the data retrieved from the getIDs Promise object 
        
        - We can now use another then() method call to chain call on the previous then() - remembering that we call the getRecipe() method on this which returns a new Promise object - to do something on the retrieved data that we got when passing an ID that is linked to the recipes

        So think of it like this
            - IDs: stored in a table
            - Recipes: stored in a table that are linked by IDs

        Conclusion:
        - Promise(s) allow us to write asynchronous code (concurrent code from JavaScript WebAPIs) without having to write a waterfall of callbacks

        - Promises can be written as separate components (in this example reference type variables) which all hold Promise Objects
        We can write them in 2 ways (so far in these examples)
            - As simple Promise objects which we can run a task on a background Thread
            - As a return type from an anonymous function where we can pass in data to that task to be ran on a background Thread
        
        - We can chain then() and catch() methods together with a Promise object

        - If we return a new Promise object within a then() method, we can chain the 2 then()s together like so
            
            Promise
            .then(param => return new Promise(
                (resolve, reject) => {...})
            )
            .then(param => {...})

        By doing so we can use the data retrieved from Promise object, and pass that data into another Promise object to do processing on that retrieved data

        Link: https://javascript.info/async-await
        Also saved in the directory
        
        Async: Will tell the JS compiler that a function always returns a promise
        
        - Other values are wrapped in a resolved promise        
          automatically.

        - For instance, this function returns a resolved promise  
          with the result of 1; let’s test it:
            async function f() {
                return 1;
            }

            f().then(alert); // 1

        Await: The keyword await makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.

        - Here’s an example with a promise that resolves in 1 second:
            async function f() {

                let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                    setTimeout(() => resolve("done!"), 1000)
                });

                let result = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves (*)

                alert(result); // "done!"
            }

            f();

        NOTE: We cannot use the await keyword in top-level code, it can only be used within a function that has been made async

        - The async keyword before a function has two effects:
            1. Makes it always return a promise.
            2. Allows await to be used in it.

        - The await keyword before a promise makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles, and then:
            1. If it’s an error, the exception is generated — same as if throw error were called at that very place.
            2. Otherwise, it returns the result.

        
        JS runs on a single thread so to have pure asynchronous code we need use the primitive asynchronous code in JavaScript WebAPIs

        This code example shows pure asynchronous code in work
        
        setTimeout() is a primitive concurrent code and will sit on the WebAPI waiting for 2 seconds with the callback function 
        
        How it Runs?
        1. we enter func1() - push func1() onto the CallStack
            a. We then enter console.log(), push that onto the CallStack and execute the code
            b. console.log() returns and pops off the CallStack
        
        2. We call the func2() using the await keyword to consume a promise
            a. This promise is a timeOut function, so this will copy the callback function (so the contents of the setTimeout function and its code and sit in the webAPI waiting for 2 seconds)
        
        3. We reach the next console.log(), however we actually store the line before execution onto in func1() VO (View Object) and pop func1() from the CallStack

        4. The timeout function has finished processing and the callback function is then appended to the messageQueue, as the CallStack is empty we push the callback function onto the CallStack and execute the code

        5. func1() VO is then retrieved and execution of the console.log() happens
            a. Push console.log() onto the CallStack
            b. console.log() returns and pop the console.log() from the CallStack
        
        6. The program has reached the end and terminates


                function func2() {
                    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                        setTimeout(() => {
                            for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                                console.log(i);
                            }
                            resolve("Promise Returned From func2()");
                        }, 2000);
                    });
                }
     
                async function func1() {
                    console.log("Entered func1()");
                    let message_from_func2 = await func2();
                    console.log(message_from_func2);
                }
        
            func1();
            console.log("This is the last line of the program");
